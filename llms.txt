Project: Dodo

Purpose:
Dodo is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for database operations, with a particular focus on Apache Doris. It helps users manage, test, and simulate database workloads.

Key Features:
- Schema and Query Dumping: Extracts database structures (tables, views) and SQL queries from audit logs.
- Fake Data Generation: Creates realistic synthetic data for tables based on their schemas and customizable rules. This is valuable for testing, development, and populating databases without using real sensitive data.
- Data Import: Facilitates importing generated data or any CSV data into database tables.
- Query Replay: Allows re-execution of SQL queries captured from audit logs to simulate production database activity, aiding in performance testing and debugging.
- Replay Result Comparison: Provides utilities to compare the outcomes of different query replay sessions or to compare replay results against original query outputs.
- SQL Anonymization: Obfuscates database, table, and column names in SQL queries, enabling the sharing of query logs or schemas without revealing sensitive information.
- Flexible Configuration: Supports configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, and dedicated configuration files.

Main Commands:
- `dodo dump`: Dumps database schemas and/or queries from audit logs.
- `dodo create`: Creates tables and views in a database, often using schemas dumped by `dodo dump`.
- `dodo gendata`: Generates CSV data for tables based on SQL schema files.
- `dodo import`: Imports data from CSV files (often generated by `dodo gendata`) into database tables.
- `dodo replay`: Replays SQL queries from files (typically generated by `dodo dump`).
- `dodo diff`: Compares the results of replay sessions.
- `dodo anonymize`: Anonymizes identifiers in SQL statements.
- `dodo completion`: Generates shell completion scripts.

Typical Workflows:
1. No data generation needed: `Dump -> Replay -> Diff Replay Results`
2. Data generation needed: `Dump -> Create Schemas (Optional) -> Generate and Import Data -> Replay -> Diff Replay Results`

Installation:
Users can install Dodo using a provided shell script:
`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thearas/dodo/master/install.sh | bash`

Building from Source:
The project can be built from source using `make`. Optional dependencies like vectorscan/hyperscan can be included for enhanced performance by using `make build-hyper`.
